### CN2 - 3 Pin Power Connector

Pin | Name
----|-----------
  1 | +5V Supply
  2 | T̅E̅S̅T̅
  3 | GND

The T̅E̅S̅T̅ pin is pulled up internally.
For testing, connect to GND while powering up.
Then the display will show all pixels lit (red+blue).
For normal operation, connect to +5V or leave open while powering up.
Then the display will show a random pattern according to the undefined state of the display buffer.

## Interfacing the Display

### Writing Data

Writing data is accomplished by setting C̅/D to 1, setting up values on address and data bus, and then toggling W̅R̅ from 1 to 0 (falling edge).

### Writing Control Codes

Writing control codes is accomplished by setting C̅/D to 0, setting up values on address and data bus, and then toggling W̅R̅ from 1 to 0 (falling edge).

## Display Buffer Arrangement

Writing data to addresses 0x00-0x13 and 0x20-0x33 will affect the displayed image.
The data written to the range starting at 0x00 will affect the blue color of the pixels.
The data written to the range starting at 0x20 will affect the red color of the pixels.
Addresses 0x00 and 0x20 correspond to the leftmost pixel column of the display.
Addresses 0x13 and 0x33 correspond to the rightmost pixel column of the display.
The least significant bit of data corresponds to the topmost pixel row of the display.
The most significant bit of data corresponds to the bottom pixel row of the display.
A set bit in the data lights the pixel.

Column    | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |10 |11 |12 |13 |14 |15 |16 |17 |18 |19

## Brightness Control

Brightness can be controlled by writing control code to address 0x3F.
Only the two least significant bits d0 and d1 will be considered according to the following table:

d7 |d6 |d5 |d4 |d3 |d2 |d1 |d0 | Brightness
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|-----------
 x | x | x | x | x | x | 0 | 0 | lowest
 x | x | x | x | x | x | 0 | 1 | low
 x | x | x | x | x | x | 1 | 0 | high
 x | x | x | x | x | x | 1 | 1 | highest
